#Face Recognition Software

#To run this project, 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Step 1: 
Install below softwares

1. Python 2.7

2. Numpy

3. Matplotlib

4. OpenCV 3.0

Note : All softwares should be installed at their default directories.

#Step 2 :
After installing the above softwares we need to do one more thing, since this is the face recognition software we need the face module inside our python
(C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages). For this i have already built the face module from binaries using this github(https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib).
You can see there is a folder called face inside module folder. So i have already provided a file called cv2.pyd and all necessary .dll files in a folder called "Important files" in my repository.
Go ahead and copy all the files (ie, cv2.pyd and .dll files and paste them inside C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\ folder .

PS: If you want to learn how to (cmake) build from binaries, then try this (http://audhootchavancv.blogspot.in/2015/08/how-to-install-opencv-30-and.html).

#Step 3: 
Go ahead and open the main.py file from my dowaloaded repository folder in Idle or any other python-compiler attched software like pycharms.
Hit F5 in idle or press Run button in other case.

You have successfully run the software.
#Note:
Your python-compiler location must be present in the OS environment variables if you are running the project from directories other than python.
